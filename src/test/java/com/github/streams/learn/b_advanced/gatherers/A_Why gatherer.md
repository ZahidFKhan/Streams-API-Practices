# ðŸ’¡ Why the Gatherer? (The Problem it Solves)

Prior to the **Gatherer**, the Java **Stream API** offered a fixed set of intermediate transformations:

| Operation | Transformation Type | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `map` | One-to-One | $1 \rightarrow 1$ (e.g., squaring a number) |
| `filter` | One-to-Zero/One | $1 \rightarrow 0$ or $1$ (e.g., removing a number) |
| `flatMap` | One-to-Many | $1 \rightarrow \text{Many}$ (e.g., splitting a string into words) |

---

Many common stream processing tasks require operations that inspect **multiple upstream elements** to produce a resultâ€”a pattern often referred to as a **"many-to-many" transformation** ($\text{Many} \rightarrow \text{Many}$).

Implementing these many-to-many operations was previously **cumbersome or awkward**, often requiring the use of the `reduce` terminal operation or relying on **mutable state** defined outside of a clean, dedicated intermediate operation.

The **Gatherer** solves this by providing a standardized, clean way to implement these complex intermediate transformations.
